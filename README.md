A Font inspired by letters found in advertising banners for Pizza Slice Restaurants in NYC and more generally within the vernaclar of the bodega sign, laundries, and delis. The idea is not to try to reproduce one to one the aesthetic of letters in vinyl cut by hand using a utility knife; this would result in something monstrous. Rather we are interested in producing something with all the charm of Pizza Counter vernacular lettering and only the appropriate level of “ugliness”. We can see a lot of interesting possibilities in digital type inspired by these letterforms, as evidenced in our photolettering/letraset research examples.The weight of the glyphs seem to be inconsistent due to the necessity of fitting them in improvised spaces which is a characteristic of vernacular typefaces and leads the project to a variable font.
